# Matchbox Radio

After stupidy running the 'sudo apt purge python3' command, my rpi broke and had to be factory reset. Unfortunately all rescources on this project were not saved to GitHub. So I'm having to restart this project from scratch.

## Transistors

To first understand how an radio works, we need to understand how a transistor (BJT)  acts as an amplifier.

Specifically we lookat common emitter transistors, as wellas biasing transistors.

We also explore some important transistor circuits, such as current mirrors and differential pairs.

##  Amplifiers 

The file 'opamps.md'contains some notes on operational amplifiers and 

## Loop-Stick Antenna

For the reciever I am going to use a loop-stick antenna. This consists of a ferrite rod with copperwire wrappped around it. This is then connected to a variable capacitor.

## External Rescources

Berkeley has a course, EE105, which contains brilliant lab scripts
